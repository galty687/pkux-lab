Emma Thompson is a visiting PhD student from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), conducting research on social computing and the design of online creative communities. Her visit to PKUX LAB is part of a collaborative research project exploring cross-cultural aspects of digital collaboration.

## Research Background

Emma's research sits at the intersection of human-computer interaction, social psychology, and computational social science. She investigates how the design of digital platforms influences community formation, creativity, and collaboration patterns across different cultural contexts.

## Current Research

Her current projects include:

- **Cross-Cultural Community Design**: Comparing how design patterns affect community behavior in Eastern vs. Western digital platforms
- **Creative Collaboration Tools**: Developing new interfaces that support distributed creative work across time zones and cultures
- **Community Governance Systems**: Studying how different moderation and governance mechanisms affect community health and productivity

## Academic Achievements

- **Publications**: 8 conference papers, 3 journal articles
- **Awards**: Best Paper Award at CSCW 2023, NSF Graduate Research Fellowship
- **Grants**: Co-PI on NSF grant for "Cultural Dimensions of Online Collaboration" ($500K)
- **Leadership**: President of MIT Graduate Student Council (2023-2024)

## Education

- **2021-Present**: PhD in Computer Science, MIT
- **2019-2021**: Master of Science in Computer Science, Stanford University
- **2015-2019**: Bachelor of Arts in Cognitive Science, University of California, Berkeley

## Skills and Expertise

- **Programming**: Python, R, JavaScript, Java, SQL
- **Data Analysis**: Network analysis, statistical modeling, machine learning
- **Research Methods**: Mixed methods, ethnography, large-scale data analysis
- **Platforms**: Social media APIs, web scraping, cloud computing (AWS, GCP)
- **Languages**: English (native), Mandarin (intermediate), Spanish (conversational)

## Professional Activities

- **Reviewer**: CHI, CSCW, ICWSM, HCI journals
- **Industry**: Research intern at Meta Reality Labs (2023), Google Research (2022)
- **Speaking**: Keynote speaker at Social Computing Symposium 2024
- **Mentorship**: Mentor for undergraduate research program at MIT

## International Collaboration

Emma's visit to PKUX LAB is part of her dissertation research on cultural factors in online community design. She is particularly interested in understanding how Chinese social platforms have evolved differently from Western platforms and what design lessons can be learned.

## Notable Publications

- "Cultural Patterns in Online Creative Communities" (CHI 2024)
- "The Role of Hierarchy in Digital Collaboration" (CSCW 2023) - **Best Paper Award**
- "Designing for Cross-Cultural Remote Teams" (TOCHI 2023)

## Community Engagement

Emma is actively involved in promoting diversity in computer science. She co-founded the "Women in Social Computing" network and regularly speaks at conferences about inclusive research practices and international collaboration.

## Personal Interests

Emma enjoys learning about different cultures through food and language. During her time in Beijing, she has been studying Mandarin and exploring Chinese digital culture firsthand. She also practices rock climbing and photography, often combining these hobbies during her travels for research conferences.
