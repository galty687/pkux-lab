Zhao Meilin is a first-year Master's student in Applied Psychology with a focus on user experience research and inclusive design. Her interdisciplinary approach combines psychological research methods with design thinking to create more accessible and usable interfaces for diverse user populations.

## Research Background

Coming from a psychology background, Zhao Meilin brings a deep understanding of human cognition and behavior to the field of human-computer interaction. Her research focuses particularly on how age-related changes in perception, cognition, and motor skills affect technology use.

## Current Research

Her current projects include:

- **Age-Friendly Interface Design**: Investigating design principles that make digital interfaces more accessible for older adults
- **Cognitive Load in Complex Systems**: Studying how interface complexity affects task performance across different age groups
- **Touch Interaction Patterns**: Analyzing how motor skill changes impact touch-based interface usage

## Academic Achievements

- **Publications**: 1 workshop paper, 2 conference abstracts
- **Research Projects**: Lead researcher on "Digital Inclusion for Seniors" project funded by Beijing Social Science Foundation
- **Awards**: Outstanding Undergraduate Thesis Award (2024)
- **Certifications**: Certified UX Researcher (Nielsen Norman Group, 2024)
