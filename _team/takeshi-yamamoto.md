Takeshi Yamamoto is an exchange PhD student from the University of Tokyo's Graduate School of Information Science and Technology. His research focuses on mobile interaction design and creating seamless experiences across multiple connected devices in ubiquitous computing environments.

## Research Background

Takeshi's research explores the future of human-device interaction in an increasingly connected world. He investigates how people naturally interact with multiple devices simultaneously and develops new interaction paradigms that make technology more intuitive and context-aware.

## Current Research

His current projects include:

- **Cross-Device Gesture Recognition**: Developing gesture systems that work consistently across smartphones, tablets, smart watches, and AR glasses
- **Contextual Interface Adaptation**: Creating interfaces that automatically adapt based on user location, activity, and available devices
- **Tangible-Digital Integration**: Bridging physical and digital interactions through novel sensing technologies

## Academic Achievements

- **Publications**: 6 conference papers, 2 journal articles
- **Awards**: Best Demo Award at UIST 2023, Outstanding Student Award UTokyo 2024
- **Patents**: 2 patents pending in Japan for "Multi-Device Gesture Recognition System"
- **Fellowships**: JSPS Research Fellowship for Young Scientists (2024)

## Education

- **2022-Present**: PhD in Information Science and Technology, University of Tokyo
- **2020-2022**: Master of Information Science and Technology, University of Tokyo
- **2016-2020**: Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Tokyo Institute of Technology

## Skills and Expertise

- **Programming**: Java, C++, Python, Swift, Kotlin, Arduino
- **Hardware**: Sensor integration, IoT systems, embedded systems, 3D printing
- **Mobile Development**: Android, iOS, cross-platform frameworks
- **Research Tools**: OpenCV, TensorFlow, Unity, Processing
- **Languages**: Japanese (native), English (fluent), Mandarin (learning)

## Professional Activities

- **Industry Collaboration**: Research collaboration with Sony Mobile Communications
- **Conferences**: UIST 2024, CHI 2023, UbiComp 2023, MobileHCI 2024
- **Open Source**: Contributor to Flutter and React Native gesture libraries
- **Student Organizations**: Vice President of HCI Student Association at UTokyo

## International Experience

Takeshi's exchange at PKUX LAB is his first extended international research experience. He is particularly interested in comparing interaction patterns and preferences between Japanese and Chinese users, especially in mobile and wearable device usage.

## Notable Projects

- **GestureBridge**: A system that enables gesture commands to transfer between connected devices
- **ContextFlow**: An adaptive interface framework that changes based on environmental context
- **TangiSync**: A platform for synchronizing tangible and digital interactions across devices

## Research Philosophy

Takeshi believes that technology should seamlessly integrate into daily life without requiring users to adapt their natural behaviors. His work focuses on making complex multi-device interactions feel as natural as interacting with physical objects.

## Cultural Exchange

During his time in Beijing, Takeshi has been studying Chinese technology culture and mobile interaction patterns. He is particularly fascinated by the integration of mobile payments and super-apps in Chinese daily life, which provides insights for his research on ubiquitous computing.

## Personal Interests

Takeshi enjoys traditional Japanese calligraphy (書道) and finds parallels between the flowing movements in calligraphy and natural gesture design. He also practices kendo and is learning Chinese martial arts during his exchange, exploring how traditional movement practices can inform modern interaction design. Photography is another passion, particularly capturing the intersection of traditional and modern technology in urban environments.
