Sophia Müller is a visiting Master's student from ETH Zurich's Department of Computer Science, specializing in explainable AI and algorithmic transparency. Her research focuses on designing interfaces that make AI decision-making processes more understandable and trustworthy for end users.

## Research Background

Sophia's interdisciplinary research combines computer science, ethics, and design to address one of the most pressing challenges in modern AI: how to make complex algorithmic systems understandable to the people they affect. Her work bridges technical AI explainability methods with human-centered interface design.

## Current Research

Her current projects include:

- **AI Explanation Interfaces**: Designing visual and interactive explanations for machine learning model decisions
- **Algorithmic Transparency Tools**: Creating interfaces that allow users to understand and audit AI systems in real-world applications
- **Cross-Cultural AI Trust**: Studying how cultural differences affect trust and understanding of AI explanations

## Academic Achievements

- **Publications**: 3 workshop papers, 1 conference paper under review
- **Thesis Project**: "Cultural Perspectives on AI Transparency" - comparing European and Chinese approaches
- **Awards**: ETH Excellence Scholarship (2023-2025)
- **Teaching**: Teaching Assistant for "Human-Computer Interaction" at ETH Zurich

## Education

- **2023-Present**: Master of Science in Computer Science, ETH Zurich
- **2020-2023**: Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, ETH Zurich
- **Exchange Semester**: Technical University of Munich (Fall 2022)

## Skills and Expertise

- **Programming**: Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, R, Java
- **AI/ML**: scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch, LIME, SHAP
- **Web Development**: React, D3.js, Vue.js, Node.js
- **Design Tools**: Figma, Adobe Creative Suite, Sketch
- **Languages**: German (native), English (fluent), French (intermediate), Mandarin (beginner)

## Professional Activities

- **Research**: Intern at Google DeepMind Ethics & Safety team (Summer 2024)
- **Conferences**: FAccT 2024, CHI 2024 Workshop on AI Transparency
- **Community**: Co-founder of "AI Ethics Reading Group" at ETH Zurich
- **Outreach**: Regular speaker at "AI for Everyone" public lecture series

## International Perspective

Sophia's visit to PKUX LAB is motivated by her thesis research on cross-cultural differences in AI understanding and trust. She is particularly interested in how Chinese users perceive and interact with AI explanations compared to European users.

## Research Methodology

- **Mixed Methods**: Combining quantitative analysis of explanation effectiveness with qualitative studies of user understanding
- **Cross-Cultural Studies**: Comparative research across different cultural contexts
- **Participatory Design**: Involving diverse stakeholders in the design of AI explanation systems
- **Ethical Analysis**: Applying ethical frameworks to evaluate AI transparency approaches

## Notable Projects

- **ExplainBot**: An interactive chatbot that explains AI decisions through conversational interfaces
- **TransparencyDashboard**: A visual tool for auditing algorithmic decision-making in public services
- **CulturalAI**: A framework for designing culturally-sensitive AI explanations

## Ethical Commitment

Sophia is deeply committed to responsible AI development and believes that transparency and explainability are fundamental rights in the age of algorithmic decision-making. Her work aims to democratize understanding of AI systems.

## Future Goals

After completing her Master's degree, Sophia plans to pursue a PhD focusing on the intersection of AI ethics, cultural studies, and interface design. She aspires to work on policy recommendations for AI transparency regulations.

## Personal Interests

Sophia enjoys hiking in the Swiss Alps and finds that nature provides clarity for thinking about complex technical problems. She is also passionate about sustainable technology and volunteers with organizations promoting green computing practices. During her time in Beijing, she has been exploring Chinese philosophy and its perspectives on technology and society, which inform her understanding of cultural approaches to AI ethics.
