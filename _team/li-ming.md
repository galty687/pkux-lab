Li Ming is a third-year PhD student specializing in information visualization and cognitive aspects of human-computer interaction. His research focuses on understanding how different visualization techniques affect cognitive load and user performance.

## Research Background

Li Ming's work bridges computer science and cognitive psychology, investigating how the human mind processes visual information in digital interfaces. His doctoral research aims to develop evidence-based guidelines for creating visualizations that minimize cognitive burden while maximizing information comprehension.

## Current Research

His current projects include:

- **Cognitive Load Metrics for Data Visualization**: Developing new methods to measure and predict cognitive load in data visualization interfaces
- **Adaptive Information Displays**: Creating interfaces that adjust complexity based on user cognitive capacity
- **Eye-tracking Studies**: Using eye-tracking technology to understand visual attention patterns in information-rich interfaces

## Academic Achievements

- **Publications**: 3 conference papers, 2 journal articles
- **Awards**: Outstanding Student Paper Award at CHI 2023
- **Grants**: National Graduate Student Research Innovation Grant (2023)
- **Teaching**: Teaching Assistant for "Introduction to HCI" (2022-2024)
