# GitHub Setup Guide for PKUX LAB Website

This guide walks you through setting up the PKUX LAB website on GitHub and enabling GitHub Pages hosting.

## üöÄ Quick Setup (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. **Go to GitHub**: Visit [github.com](https://github.com) and sign in
2. **Create new repository**:
   - Click the "+" icon ‚Üí "New repository"
   - Repository name: `pkuxlab.github.io` (recommended) or `pkux-lab-website`
   - Description: "Official website for PKUX LAB - Peking University Information Experience Lab"
   - Set to **Public** (required for free GitHub Pages)
   - **Do NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
   - Click "Create repository"

### Step 2: Upload Your Website Files

**Option A: Using GitHub Web Interface (Easier)**

1. **Upload files**:
   - On your new repository page, click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag and drop ALL files from your `/Users/zhijungao/Desktop/PKUXLAB/` folder
   - Or click "choose your files" and select all files/folders
   - **Important**: Make sure to include hidden files like `.gitignore` and `.github/` folder

2. **Commit files**:
   - Scroll down to "Commit new files"
   - Title: "Initial website setup"
   - Description: "Add PKUX LAB bilingual Jekyll website with GitHub Pages deployment"
   - Click "Commit new files"

**Option B: Using Git Commands (Advanced)**

```bash
# Navigate to your website folder
cd /Users/zhijungao/Desktop/PKUXLAB

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Make initial commit
git commit -m "Initial website setup with bilingual Jekyll site"

# Add GitHub repository as remote (replace URL with your actual repository)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/pkuxlab.github.io.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to repository settings**:
   - Click "Settings" tab in your repository
   - Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar

2. **Configure Pages**:
   - Source: Select "**GitHub Actions**" (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
   - This enables our custom workflow for Jekyll

3. **Save settings**:
   - Click "Save" if required
   - You should see a green checkmark or pending status

### Step 4: Wait for Deployment

1. **Monitor deployment**:
   - Go to "Actions" tab in your repository
   - You should see a workflow called "Deploy Jekyll Site to GitHub Pages" running
   - This takes 2-5 minutes for the first deployment

2. **Check deployment status**:
   - Green checkmark = Success ‚úÖ
   - Red X = Failed ‚ùå (check logs for errors)
   - Yellow circle = In progress ‚è≥

3. **Access your website**:
   - Once deployed, visit: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY_NAME`
   - For `pkuxlab.github.io` repository: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io`

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**‚ùå Build Failed**
- Go to Actions tab and click on the failed workflow
- Check logs for error details
- Common fixes:
  - Ensure all files were uploaded correctly
  - Check for typos in `_config.yml`
  - Verify `Gemfile` is present

**‚ùå Site Shows "Page Not Found"**
- Check if GitHub Pages is enabled in Settings ‚Üí Pages
- Verify repository is public
- Wait 5-10 minutes after enabling Pages

**‚ùå Site Loads but Looks Broken**
- Check `_config.yml` URL setting matches your GitHub Pages URL
- Verify CSS and image files were uploaded to `assets/` folder

**‚ùå GitHub Actions Not Running**
- Ensure you selected "GitHub Actions" as source (not "Deploy from a branch")
- Check if `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file exists
- Repository must be public for free GitHub Pages

### Verification Steps

Run this command in your local website folder to verify everything is ready:
```bash
./verify-deployment.sh
```

All checks should show green ‚úÖ before proceeding.
