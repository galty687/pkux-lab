## Project Overview

This research project investigates methods for optimizing user interfaces in complex information systems, focusing on reducing cognitive load while maintaining functionality and accessibility.

## Background

As digital systems become increasingly complex, users often struggle with information overload and interface complexity. This project aims to develop evidence-based guidelines for creating more intuitive and efficient user interfaces.

## Research Objectives

1. **Cognitive Load Analysis**: Study how different interface elements affect user cognitive load
2. **Design Pattern Development**: Create reusable design patterns for complex systems
3. **User Testing Framework**: Develop comprehensive testing methodologies
4. **Implementation Guidelines**: Provide practical guidelines for designers and developers

## Methodology

Our approach combines:
- **Quantitative Studies**: Eye-tracking, task completion metrics, error rates
- **Qualitative Research**: User interviews, think-aloud protocols
- **Prototype Development**: Iterative design and testing of interface solutions
- **Field Studies**: Real-world implementation and evaluation

## Current Progress

- âœ… Literature review completed
- âœ… Initial user studies conducted (n=45)
- ðŸ”„ Prototype development in progress
- ðŸ“… Field testing planned for Q2 2024

## Expected Outcomes

- Framework for UI complexity assessment
- Design guidelines for complex systems
- Open-source toolkit for designers
- Academic publications and conference presentations

## Collaborations

This project is conducted in collaboration with:
- Beijing Institute of Technology
- Tencent User Experience Research
- Microsoft Research Asia
