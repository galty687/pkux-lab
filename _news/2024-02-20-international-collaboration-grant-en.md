We are delighted to announce that PKUX Laboratory has successfully secured a three-year international collaborative research project grant worth 3 million RMB. This project will involve collaboration with several top European universities, focusing on cross-cultural information experience design research.

## Project Background

As globalization deepens, designing information interfaces suitable for users from different cultural backgrounds has become an important research topic. This international collaboration project aims to deeply study how cultural factors influence users' information processing methods and interface preferences.

## Partnership Institutions

The main partners for this international collaboration project include:

- **Delft University of Technology, Netherlands** - Human-Computer Interaction Research Center
- **Aalto University, Finland** - School of Design
- **Technical University of Munich, Germany** - Department of Computer Science
- **École Normale Supérieure, Paris, France** - Cognitive Science Laboratory

## Research Focus

The project will focus on several core research areas:

### 1. Cross-Cultural Cognitive Differences Research
Using eye-tracking, EEG, and other technical methods to analyze cognitive differences in information processing among users from different cultural backgrounds.

### 2. Culture-Adaptive Interface Design
Developing intelligent interface systems that can automatically adjust based on users' cultural backgrounds, providing personalized information experiences.

### 3. Multilingual Information Architecture Optimization
Studying the impact of different languages and scripts on information organization and presentation, establishing design standards for multilingual information architecture.

## Team Involvement

The project will be led by Dr. Zhang Wei as the Chinese principal investigator, with Dr. Chen Yifan serving as project coordinator responsible for international cooperation affairs. Multiple doctoral and master's students from the laboratory will participate in the specific research work.

## Expected Outcomes

During the three-year project execution period, we expect to produce:

- **15-20 high-level academic papers** published at top conferences such as CHI and UIST
- **Cross-cultural design guidance framework** providing practical design guidelines for global designers
- **Open-source toolkit** helping developers create culture-adaptive interfaces
- **Talent development** through international exchanges to cultivate researchers with global perspectives

## Social Significance

This research not only has important academic value but is also expected to have broad impact in practical applications. As Chinese companies increasingly enter international markets, designing product interfaces suitable for users from different cultures has become an urgent problem to solve.

## International Impact

The successful approval of this project not only reflects the international academic community's recognition of PKUX Laboratory's research capabilities but also pioneers a new model for deep cooperation between China and Europe in the field of human-computer interaction.

We look forward to making greater contributions to the development of global information experience design through this international collaboration!
