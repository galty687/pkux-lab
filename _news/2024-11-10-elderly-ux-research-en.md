PKUX Laboratory made important progress in the field of accessible design. Master's student Zhao Meilin's paper "Digital Inclusion for Aging Populations: Design Principles for Age-Friendly Interfaces" has been officially accepted by CHI 2025, the top conference in human-computer interaction.

## Research Background

With the accelerating trend of global population aging, how to better integrate elderly people into the digital age has become an important social issue. Existing digital products often ignore the special needs of elderly users, leading to increasingly serious digital divide problems.

## Research Methods

Under the guidance of her advisor Professor Zhang Wei, Zhao Meilin adopted mixed research methods:

- **User Research**: In-depth interviews with 100 digital product users over 60 years old
- **Usability Testing**: Comparative analysis of the impact of different interface designs on elderly users
- **Physiological Indicator Monitoring**: Using eye-tracking technology to analyze visual behavior patterns of elderly users

## Core Findings

The research proposes "Seven Principles of Age-Friendly Interface Design":

1. **Simplified Information Architecture**: Reduce cognitive load
2. **Enhanced Visual Contrast**: Adapt to vision changes
3. **Enlarged Touch Targets**: Consider decreased fine motor skills
4. **Multi-modal Feedback**: Combine visual, auditory, and tactile feedback
5. **Progressive Learning Support**: Step-by-step operation guidance
6. **Error-tolerant Design**: Allow undo and redo operations
7. **Integrated Social Support**: Facilitate help from family and friends

## Social Impact

The research results have been applied to multiple practical projects, including collaboration with Tencent on WeChat's elderly-friendly version interface optimization and cooperation with Beijing Municipal Government on smart elderly care platform design.

Zhao Meilin stated: "This research made me deeply realize that good design should allow everyone to enjoy the convenience brought by technology. I hope to contribute to building a more inclusive digital society through my efforts."
