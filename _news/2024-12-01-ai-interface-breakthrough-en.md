PKUX Laboratory announces a major breakthrough in the field of artificial intelligence-assisted interface design. The research team led by Professor Zhang Wei has successfully developed a revolutionary AI interface design system after 18 months of work, which can automatically generate highly personalized interface layouts based on users' specific needs and usage habits.

## Technical Innovation

This system, named "IntelliDesign," integrates deep learning, computer vision, and human-computer interaction theory, with the following core features:

- **Intelligent Layout Generation**: Automatically optimizes interface element arrangement based on user behavior data
- **Real-time Adaptability**: Dynamically adjusts interface design according to usage patterns
- **Multi-platform Compatibility**: Supports mobile, desktop, and VR/AR environments

## Research Results

Initial testing shows that interfaces designed using the IntelliDesign system scored 35% higher in user experience ratings compared to traditional design methods, with task completion efficiency improved by 28%.

The research results will be officially published at the CHI 2025 conference, and cooperation intentions have been received from multiple technology companies.
