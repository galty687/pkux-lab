PKUX Laboratory today announced the establishment of a strategic partnership with MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (MIT CSAIL). Both parties will jointly research the design and implementation of cross-cultural digital collaboration platforms in a three-year cooperation project.

## Background

With the acceleration of globalization, cross-cultural team collaboration has become an important feature of modern work environments. However, existing digital collaboration tools often ignore the impact of cultural differences on user experience.

## Project Objectives

This collaboration project aims to:

- **Cultural Adaptive Design**: Develop collaborative interfaces that can automatically adapt to different cultural backgrounds
- **Communication Pattern Research**: In-depth analysis of communication differences between Eastern and Western cultures in digital environments
- **Cross-timezone Collaboration Optimization**: Design new tools to support efficient collaboration for global teams

## Research Team

The project is jointly led by Professor Zhang Wei from PKUX LAB and Professor David Smith from MIT CSAIL. Visiting scholar Emma Thompson from MIT is currently conducting related research work in our laboratory.

## Expected Outcomes

The project is expected to produce multiple high-quality academic papers and develop a cross-cultural collaboration platform prototype with practical application value. The first batch of research results is expected to be published at the CSCW 2025 conference.

*This project is jointly funded by the National Science Foundations of China and the United States.*
