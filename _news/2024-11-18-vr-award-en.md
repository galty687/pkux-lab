PKUX Laboratory achieved another honor in the field of virtual reality applications. PhD student Sun Jiawei's research project "NeuroVR: Immersive Brain Imaging Data Visualization System" won the Best Demo Award at the IEEE VIS 2024 conference.

## Project Overview

NeuroVR is a revolutionary virtual reality platform specifically designed for brain imaging data visualization in neuroscience research. The system allows researchers to intuitively explore and analyze complex brain structure data in three-dimensional virtual space.

## Technical Highlights

- **Immersive Interaction**: Supports natural hand gesture operations, allowing users to directly "touch" and manipulate 3D brain models
- **Multi-modal Data Fusion**: Integrates multiple brain imaging data types such as fMRI and DTI
- **Collaborative Analysis**: Supports multiple users conducting collaborative research simultaneously in virtual environments

## Application Prospects

The system has been tested at Beijing Tiantan Hospital's Department of Neurosurgery, where doctors reported that data visualization in VR environments greatly improved the accuracy and efficiency of surgical planning.

## Academic Recognition

In addition to winning the IEEE VIS Best Demo Award, the related research paper has been accepted for publication in the top-tier journal IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics.

Sun Jiawei stated: "This award is not only recognition of my personal research, but also reflects PKUX LAB's innovative strength in cutting-edge technology applications. We will continue to advance the application of VR technology in scientific visualization."
