PKUX Laboratory continues to grow and develop, officially welcoming three new members this month, injecting new vitality and innovative thinking into the laboratory.

## New Member Introductions

### Dr. Li Ming, Postdoctoral Researcher
From the Department of Computer Science at Tsinghua University, specializing in machine learning and human-computer interaction. Dr. Li Ming has extensive research experience in interactive machine learning and has published multiple papers at top conferences such as ICML and NeurIPS. He will primarily be responsible for machine learning algorithm development in the laboratory's AI-assisted design projects.

### Wang Yaqi, Master's Student
An outstanding graduate from Peking University's School of Psychology and Cognitive Sciences, with research interests focused on the intersection of user experience design and cognitive psychology. She will participate in the laboratory's age-friendly interface design project, providing psychological theoretical support for product design.

### Zhang Haoran, Master's Student
From Beijing Institute of Technology's Software Engineering program, with solid technical foundation in front-end development and interaction design. He will primarily be responsible for the development and technical implementation of laboratory research prototypes.

## Team Development

With the addition of new members, the PKUX Laboratory team has expanded to 18 people, covering multiple disciplinary backgrounds including computer science, psychology, design, and cognitive science. This multidisciplinary team composition provides strong support for the laboratory's cutting-edge research.

## Research Direction Expansion

The addition of new members also means further expansion of the laboratory's research directions:

- **Interactive Machine Learning**: Exploring new models of human-machine collaboration
- **Cognitive Load Optimization**: Improving interface design from a psychological perspective
- **Rapid Prototype Development**: Enhancing technical transformation capabilities of research results

## Future Plans

Professor Zhang Wei stated: "Team diversity is an important factor in maintaining our innovation vitality. We welcome outstanding scholars from different backgrounds to join PKUX LAB and jointly promote the development of information experience design."

The laboratory plans to continue expanding the team size in 2025, particularly recruiting more talent in VR/AR interaction design and accessibility technology research.

*PKUX LAB will hold its annual open house event in December, welcoming scholars and students interested in our research.*
