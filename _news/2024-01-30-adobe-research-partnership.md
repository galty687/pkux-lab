PKUX LAB is excited to announce a new research partnership with **Adobe Research** focused on developing next-generation creative AI tools that enhance designer productivity while preserving creative control.

## Partnership Overview

This collaboration brings together PKUX LAB's expertise in human-computer interaction and information experience design with Adobe Research's leadership in creative technology. The partnership will focus on three key areas:

### 1. AI-Assisted Design Workflows
Developing intelligent tools that can understand designer intent and provide contextual assistance throughout the design process.

### 2. Creative AI Ethics
Establishing guidelines and best practices for ethical AI integration in creative tools, ensuring AI enhances rather than replaces human creativity.

### 3. User Experience Research
Conducting comprehensive studies to understand how designers interact with AI-powered tools and what makes these collaborations most effective.

## Research Initiatives

The partnership will support several research initiatives:

- **Intelligent Layout Systems**: AI that can suggest optimal layouts based on content and design principles
- **Context-Aware Color Palettes**: Systems that recommend color schemes based on brand guidelines and accessibility requirements
- **Collaborative Design AI**: Tools that facilitate human-AI collaboration in real-time design processes

## Team Involvement

Dr. Chen Yifan will serve as the primary liaison for this collaboration, leveraging his previous experience as a Research Scientist Intern at Adobe Research. The partnership will also provide opportunities for our graduate students to work on cutting-edge creative AI projects.

## Industry Impact

"This partnership represents the future of design tools," says Dr. Zhang Wei. "By combining rigorous academic research with Adobe's practical expertise, we can create AI systems that truly enhance the creative process."

## Student Opportunities

The collaboration will provide exciting opportunities for our students:
- Internship positions at Adobe Research
- Access to Adobe's design tools and datasets
- Mentorship from industry experts
- Real-world testing of research prototypes

## Expected Outcomes

Over the next three years, we expect this partnership to produce:
- 6-8 high-impact research publications
- Open-source tools for the design community
- Integration of research findings into Adobe Creative Cloud
- Guidelines for ethical AI in design

## Global Impact

Adobe's global reach means our research will potentially impact millions of designers worldwide. The partnership aligns with both organizations' commitment to democratizing good design and making creative tools more accessible.

## Community Engagement

We plan to share our findings with the broader research community through:
- Academic conferences and workshops
- Open-source software releases
- Public talks and demonstrations
- Collaborative research with other institutions

## Looking Ahead

This partnership represents PKUX LAB's continued commitment to bridging academic research and industry practice. We're excited about the potential for this collaboration to advance the field of creative AI and look forward to sharing our progress with the community.

Stay tuned for updates on this exciting partnership and the innovative research it will produce!
