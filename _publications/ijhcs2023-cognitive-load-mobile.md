## Abstract

Understanding cognitive load in mobile interfaces is crucial for designing effective information experiences. Traditional cognitive load assessment methods often rely on subjective measures or are too intrusive for mobile contexts. This study presents a novel approach using eye-tracking metrics to objectively assess cognitive load in mobile information interfaces.

## Background

Mobile devices present unique challenges for information interface design due to screen size constraints, touch-based interaction, and usage contexts. Previous research has established the importance of cognitive load in interface effectiveness, but measurement approaches have been limited in mobile contexts.

## Methodology

We conducted a comprehensive study with 120 participants using mobile eye-tracking technology to assess cognitive load across different interface designs. Our approach combines:

- **Pupil Dilation Measurements**: Indicating cognitive effort
- **Fixation Patterns**: Revealing information processing strategies  
- **Saccade Characteristics**: Showing visual search efficiency
- **Subjective Ratings**: Validating objective measures

## Key Findings

1. **Interface Complexity**: Strong correlation (r=0.78) between visual complexity and cognitive load metrics
2. **Information Architecture**: Hierarchical organization reduced cognitive load by 34%
3. **Touch Target Design**: Larger touch targets decreased visual search time by 28%
4. **Cultural Factors**: Significant differences in cognitive load patterns between user groups

## Practical Implications

Our findings provide actionable guidelines for mobile interface designers:
- Optimal information density thresholds for different screen sizes
- Evidence-based recommendations for navigation pattern selection
- Cognitive load budgeting framework for feature prioritization

## Contributions

This work contributes:
- Validated eye-tracking protocol for mobile cognitive load assessment
- Comprehensive dataset of mobile interface cognitive load measurements
- Design guidelines based on empirical cognitive load evidence
- Open-source tools for cognitive load measurement in mobile contexts

## Future Directions

Ongoing work includes:
- Real-world deployment studies in natural mobile usage contexts
- Integration with physiological measures (EEG, heart rate variability)
- Development of real-time cognitive load monitoring systems
- Cross-cultural validation of cognitive load patterns
